# 🌌 Sign of Affection – Galaxy Photobooth

**Sign of Affection** is an interactive, galaxy-themed photobooth experience where **hand gestures become emotional signals** rendered through particles, light, and motion.  
It blends **gesture recognition**, **Three.js visuals**, and **immersive storytelling** to turn human movement into cosmic expression.

This project was built as both a **technical showcase** and a **personal dedication**, transforming connection into an interactive universe.

## ✨ Features

- **Gesture Recognition**
  - Uses MediaPipe-style hand landmark tracking to detect gestures such as:
    - ✊ Fist
    - ✋ Open Hand
    - 👍 Thumbs Up
  - Each gesture triggers a unique visual and emotional response.

- **Three.js Particle Engine**
  - Real-time star fields and particle systems
  - Dynamic motion, depth, and interaction tied to gesture input

- **Visual Filters & Color Nebula**
  - Shader-like post-processing effects
  - Gesture-driven color shifts and lighting changes

- **Affection Mapping System**
  - Gestures are mapped to:
    - Custom text messages
    - Visual filters
    - Particle behavior
  - Turns abstract emotion into structured visual output

- **Interactive Dedication Flow**
  - Encrypted envelope → authentication modal → animated flower bloom → letter reveal
  - Designed as a narrative sequence, not just UI interactions

- **Customization Deck**
  - Modify:
    - Gesture output messages
    - Visual filters per gesture
  - Live configuration before launching the experience

## 💫 Design Philosophy

This project explores the idea that **connection doesn’t disappear with distance**.  
Like stars across galaxies, signals still travel — quietly, persistently, and meaningfully.

Every animation, color, and interaction was designed to feel:
- Intentional
- Soft
- Emotional
